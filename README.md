NourishAI ü•´‚ú®
A hackathon project dedicated to fighting food insecurity by connecting communities with local food pantries through the power of AI and real-time data.

üöÄ The Mission (In a Nutshell)
Food insecurity is a massive challenge, but local communities have the power to solve it. The problem is a gap in information‚Äîpeople want to help, but don't know what is needed, where to go, or how to contribute effectively.

NourishAI bridges that gap. We built a smart, intuitive platform that makes finding food assistance and donating resources as easy as sending a text message. No more guessing games, no more wasted food‚Äîjust direct, impactful support.

üî• Core Features
We packed a ton of functionality into this app over the hackathon weekend:

üìç Interactive Pantry Finder: Utilizes the Google Maps API to display a map of nearby food pantries, markets, and shopping partners. Users can instantly see what's available in their area.

ü§ñ AI-Powered Food Donations: This is our secret sauce! A user can simply state what they want to donate (e.g., "I have 5 cans of soup and a box of pasta"). The Gemini API parses this natural language into a structured update that gets logged for the selected pantry.

‚ö°Ô∏è Real-Time Pantry Updates: Pantries have a "live" status showing the most recent food donations. This helps donors give what's actually needed and reduces waste. The logic is simple but effective: updates are merged for 48 hours before being replaced to keep info fresh.

üí≥ Secure Monetary Donations: We integrated Stripe to provide a secure, seamless payment gateway. Supporters can donate money directly to the cause with just a few clicks, without our app ever touching sensitive financial data.

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Powered & Scalable: The entire application is powered by a SQLite Cloud database and is live on the web, hosted via Render.com.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
This project was built with a fast, modern, and scalable stack perfect for a rapid hackathon build.

Backend: Flask

Database: SQLite Cloud (via sqlitecloud and SQLAlchemy)

Hosting: Render.com

Key APIs:

Google Maps API: For geocoding and mapping food pantry locations.

Google Gemini API: For natural language processing of food donation inputs.

Stripe API: For processing secure monetary donations.

SQLite Cloud: For our database connection.

‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup & Installation
Want to run this project locally? Let's get you set up in 5 minutes.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/NourishAI.git](https://github.com/your-username/NourishAI.git)
cd NourishAI

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
We've listed everything you need in requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. CRITICAL: Configure Your API Keys
This is the most important step. Our app relies on external services.

Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory. Copy the contents of .env.example (if one exists) or create it from scratch.

Your .env file must look like this:

# Get from Google Cloud Console (enable Geocoding API)
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="AIza..."

# Get from Google AI Studio
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."

# Get from your Stripe Dashboard (use test keys!)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk_test_..."

# Get from your SQLite Cloud Dashboard
SQLITECLOUD_CONNECTION_STRING="sqlitecloud://user:password@hostname.sqlite.cloud:port/database"

Where to Get Your Keys:

Google Maps & Gemini: Go to Google Cloud Console. You will need to create a project, enable the "Geocoding API" for maps, and get a Gemini key from the Google AI Studio.

Stripe: Create a free account at Stripe.com. Your test keys (pk_test and sk_test) are available in the "Developers" section of the dashboard.

SQLite Cloud: Sign up at SQLite.cloud and create a new database. The full connection string is provided on your database dashboard.

5. Run the Application
flask run

Navigate to http://1227.0.0.1:5000 in your browser and you should be live!

üöÄ What's Next? (Future Ideas)
This was an amazing hackathon build, but we're just getting started. Here's where we could take NourishAI next:

Volunteer Portal: A full sign-up and scheduling system for volunteers.

Live Inventory Management: Allow pantries to log in and manage a simple inventory, giving donors an even clearer picture of their needs.

SMS Notifications: Alert subscribed users when a local pantry has an urgent need.

Gamification: Create a points system for donations to encourage community engagement.

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for the community. Let's nourish it together.
